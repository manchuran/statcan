# statcan

This repository contains codes on tasks on establishing how size of the training instance is important to model evaluation. The investigation uses the Cars Dataset available [here](https://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html). The aim is to show to the client the need to label more data to allow for more accuracy in learning. 

The results of the investigation are contained in the attached `ipynb` notebook.

=======

#### Dependencies


The code was written using :

- Python (==3.8.10)
- NumPy (==1.22.3)
- Pandas (== 1.4.1)
- Matplotlib (== 3.5.2)
- Scipy (== 1.8.1)
- Scikit-image (==0.15.0)
- Opencv-Python (==3.4.11)
- Scikit-learn (==1.0.2)

#### Accessing Notebook


Notebook can be accessed by either downloading the `.ipynb` file or clicking the link to access the `.pdf` file.

You can move the files to a local computer using the command:

    git clone https://github.com/manchuran/statcan.git

#### Testing Code


All cells have been run and the outputs are visible. However, should it be required to rerun the cells, the first cell which carries out `wget` must be run. Though a few `.mat` files are available in this repository, the more larger image files have not been uploaded. These are too large to upload on GitHub.
